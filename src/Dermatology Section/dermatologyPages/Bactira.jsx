//         Bacteria can infect any area of the body. Pneumonia, meningitis, and food poisoning are just a few illnesses that may be caused by harmful bacteria. Bacteria come in three basic shapes: rod-shaped (bacilli), spherical (cocci), or helical (spirilla). Bacteria may also be classified as gram-positive or gram-negative. This refers to the type of cell wall the bacteria have. Gram-positive bacteria have a thick cell wall, while gram-negative bacteria have a thin cell wall. The cell wall is important because it helps protect the bacteria from the environment.

//         Gram staining, bacterial culture with antibiotic sensitivity determination, and other tests are used to identify bacterial strains and help determine the appropriate course of treatment. Bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics, which work by either killing the bacteria or stopping them from multiplying. Antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections and are not effective against viral infections.
