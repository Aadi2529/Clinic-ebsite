    description: `Hair transplantation is a minor out-patient surgery that requires 4â€“12 hours and is performed under local anesthesia. No admission is required. We perform the procedure by Follicular Unit Extraction(FUE) technique which involves direct removal of individual follicular units (each contains 1-4 hair) with the help of specialized equipment. As no cutting and suturing is required in this method, the cosmetic results are excellent in the donor area with no visible scarring. ]`,
    additionalInfo: `These small grafts are then meticulously planted into the bald or thinning area of the scalp (recipient area) maintaining same angle as the other hair present.`,
