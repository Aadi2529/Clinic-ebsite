    { title: "Is there a difference between acne and pimples?", content: "Pimples and Acne are related with each other significantly but it should be known that one cannot be confused or replaced by the other.                                                                                           Acne is a skin disease whereas Pimple is one of the symptoms for the same.                          The onset of Acne is brought by clogging of the skin pores often due to excessive release of oil in the body or from the dust in the atmosphere. Naturally it leads to the formation of the plugged pores called as blackheads, nodules, whiteheads, cysts, or pimples. Usually it appears on the face, but it could also be found on chest, neck, shoulders, back, and arms.                                                                                           Pimples are red, inflamed and infected plugged oil glands, sometimes filled with pus. This is the most common form of Acne and thus has gained a synonym for itself. However the bacterial growth inside these clogged pores are reasons for its red color and eventually we can see a white fluid accumulate on the surface." },
        { title: "What causes ance and pimples?", content: "Acne occurs when the pores on your skin become blocked with oil, dead skin, or bacteria. Each pore on your skin is the opening to a follicle. The follicle is made up of a hair and a sebaceous (oil) gland. The oil gland releases sebum (oil), which travels up the hair, out of the pore, and onto your skin." 
        },
        { title: "Can you be cured of ance?", content: "Acne Can't Be Prevented or Cured, But It Can Be Treated Effectively. ... There's no way to prevent acne, there's no cure and today's over-the-counter remedies contain the same basic ingredients as those on drugstore shelves decades ago. And acne won't just go away: Not treating it can actually make things worse." },
        { title: "Can acne scars go away?", content: "Acne is one thing, scars are another. Acne will eventually go away (really, it will). Scars, on the other hand, are a bit tougher to deal with. Doing things like picking at and popping pimples can definitely damage your skin and cause scarring. But sometimes, even if you're really careful with your skin, scars can still develop. Severe blemishes, those that are very inflamed, are more likely to scar. And for some people, even minor blemishes cause scarring." },
        {title:"Is acne in genetics?", content:"It’s a question we get all the time: “Is acne genetic?” The one-word answer is yes, acne is far more genetic than environmental. Acne genetics determine how your immune system responds to p. acnes bacteria; one person may develop only minor blackheads while another develops explosive red and tender nodules. Genetics also play a role in how easily your pores clog. For example, you may have a hereditary tendency to overproduce dead skin cells, and then shed them in a way that clogs your pores. When this leads to breakouts, you can think of it as genetic acne. Not your fault!"

        ],
        points:[
            "Topical corticosteroids. These drugs are the most frequently prescribed medications for treating mild to moderate psoriasis. They reduce inflammation and relieve itching and may be used with other treatments.Mild corticosteroid ointments are usually recommended for sensitive areas, such as your face or skin folds, and for treating widespread patches of damaged skin.Your doctor may prescribe stronger corticosteroid ointment for smaller, less sensitive or tougher-to-treat areas.Long-term use or overuse of strong corticosteroids can cause thinning of the skin. Topical corticosteroids may stop working over time. It’s usually best to use topical corticosteroids as a short-term treatment during flares.",

            "Vitamin D analogues. These synthetic forms of vitamin D slow skin cell growth. Calcipotriene (Dovonex) is a prescription cream or solution containing a vitamin D analogue that treats mild to moderate psoriasis along with other treatments. Calcipotriene might irritate your skin. Calcitriol (Vectical) is expensive but may be equally effective and possibly less irritating than calcipotriene.",

            "Anthralin. This medication helps slow skin cell growth. Anthralin (Dritho-Scalp) can also remove scales and make skin smoother. But anthralin can irritate skin, and it stains almost anything it touches. It’s usually applied for a short time and then washed off.",

            "Topical retinoids. These are vitamin A derivatives that may decrease inflammation. The most common side effect is skin irritation. These medications may also increase sensitivity to sunlight, so while using the medication apply sunscreen before going outdoors.The risk of birth defects is far lower for topical retinoids than for oral retinoids. But tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage) isn’t recommended when you’re pregnant or breast-feeding or if you intend to become pregnant.",
            "Calcineurin inhibitors. Calcineurin inhibitors — tacrolimus (Prograf) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) — reduce inflammation and plaque buildup.Calcineurin inhibitors are not recommended for long-term or continuous use because of a potential increased risk of skin cancer and lymphoma. They may be especially helpful in areas of thin skin, such as around the eyes, where steroid creams or retinoids are too irritating or may cause harmful effects.",
            "Salicylic acid. Available over-the-counter (nonprescription) and by prescription, salicylic acid promotes sloughing of dead skin cells and reduces scaling. Sometimes it’s combined with other medications, such as topical corticosteroids or coal tar, to increase its effectiveness. Salicylic acid is available in medicated shampoos and scalp solutions to treat scalp psoriasis.",
            "Coal tar. Derived from coal, coal tar reduces scaling, itching and inflammation. Coal tar can irritate the skin. It’s also messy, stains clothing and bedding, and has a strong odor.Coal tar is available in over-the-counter shampoos, creams and oils. It’s also available in higher concentrations by prescription. This treatment isn’t recommended for women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.",
            "Moisturizers. Moisturizing creams alone won’t heal psoriasis, but they can reduce itching, scaling and dryness. Moisturizers in an ointment base are usually more effective than are lighter creams and lotions. Apply immediately after a bath or shower to lock in moisture.",

Other forms of light therapy include the use of artificial ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light, either alone or in combination with medications."
      ],
      points:[
          "Sunlight. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight or artificial light slows skin cell turnover and reduces scaling and inflammation. Brief, daily exposures to small amounts of sunlight may improve psoriasis, but intense sun exposure can worsen symptoms and cause skin damage. Before beginning a sunlight regimen, ask your doctor about the safest way to use natural sunlight for psoriasis treatment..",

          "UVB phototherapy. Controlled doses of UVB light from an artificial light source may improve mild to moderate psoriasis symptoms. UVB phototherapy, also called broadband UVB, can be used to treat single patches, widespread psoriasis and psoriasis that resists topical treatments. Short-term side effects may include redness, itching and dry skin. Using a moisturizer may help decrease these side effects.",

          "Narrow band UVB phototherapy. A newer type of psoriasis treatment, narrow band UVB phototherapy may be more effective than broadband UVB treatment. It’s usually administered two or three times a week until the skin improves, and then maintenance may require only weekly sessions. Narrow band UVB phototherapy may cause more-severe and longer lasting burns, however.",

          "Goeckerman therapy. Some doctors combine UVB treatment and coal tar treatment, which is known as Goeckerman treatment. The two therapies together are more effective than either alone because coal tar makes skin more receptive to UVB light.."
