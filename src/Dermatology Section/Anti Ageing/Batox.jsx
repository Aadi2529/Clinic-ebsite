    descriptions:[
      "While there is no real downtime associated with this treatment, it is important to note that you may encounter some slight bruising and swelling directly after treatment, due to the needle. This can easily be masked by makeup. There are no long-term side effects of having wrinkle injections, meaning patients can resume their usual activities straight away, and can also fly post-treatment."

    mainheading: "Who would suit the treatment ?",
    descriptions:[
      "This treatment can be used on a wide range of patients, and is primarily used for skin rejuvenation and the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles. Botulinum toxin is injected into muscles and used to improve the look of moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines) for a short period of time. It can also be injected into the area around the side of the eyes to improve the look of moderate to severe crow’s feet lines."

  {
    mainheading: "Who should avoid this treatment ?",
    descriptions:[
      "Those who have medical conditions, such as damaged nerves or muscle complaints, should disclose this information during consultation, to avoid any complications. Treatment is not advisable for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. While there are no clinical studies to show that the injection is harmful to the baby or mother, medical professionals advise against having treatment under these circumstances."

  {
    mainheading: "What results does the treatment aim to provide ?",
    descriptions:[
      "The treatment is used to soften the lines caused by facial expression and can be adjusted to ensure natural results. The duration of results is variable in between individuals but ranges from 3 to 6 months.",
      "Typically, patients will come into the clinic and point to a specific line that they don’t like. Good practitioners shouldn’t just look at treating this specific line, but will look beyond the line at how the face looks as a whole (as treating an individual line might make the face look unnatural). Sometimes patients come in and say their colleagues and friends keep telling them that they look tired or grumpy when this isn’t the case. In these cases, it’s usually not a single line that is creating this impression, but multiple factors, and the practitioner should talk through treatment options with the patient."
